# Vignere-Cipher-with-Transposition
A basic vignere cipher with the ability to add transposition. 
All the ciphering / deciphering is done via ASCII rather than at the bit level in order to
make it a liitle more human readable if someone wants to go through and see how this type
of cipher works under the hood.
